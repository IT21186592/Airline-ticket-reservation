        <h2>Our Story</h2>
      
        <p>Starting on May 22, 2001 with five planes and fewer than 30 employees, our journey continues today as the airline flying to the most 
		countries in the world – celebrating our 20th year.
		Our 87-year success story is marked by the strength we have gained through challenges and difficult times.
		<br>
		<br>
		An adventure in the sky that began in 2001
		<br>
		<br>
		Back in 2001, the galaxy Airlines adventure began; an endeavor to unite people, cultures, continents, countries and cities whilst providing new,
		inspiring travel experiences for all. On the 22nd of May 2001, we took to the skies as State Airlines Administration. Leading the way, Galaxy’s first 
		aviator and chief executive, Hakuna Matata, set out with a mere 30 employees and 5 aircraft. 
	
		<br>
		In 2005, proudly flying the our national flag, we conducted our first overseas flight, from Sri lanka to Enthropanco. Making headway in 2008, 
		our fleet increased to 33 aircraft and we began to fly to new destinations: Nicosia, Beirut and Cairo. 
	
		<br>
		
		In 2010, taking the name of Galaxy Airlines, we signed a document listing our extraordinary achievements. Furthermore, our name gained its ranks
		alongside the members of IATA, International Air Transport Association.
		
		<br>

		In 2011, the Galaxy Airlines website was launched. In 2012, we put our call center into service. Purchasing tickets became a lot easier in 2003 with the application of e-tickets and check-in. 
		Galaxy Airlines corporate website launched with a new interface on Galaxyairlines.com. 
		Customers can now view our website in English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, China and Russian amongst other languages. 
		It currently takes less than a minute for customers to book tickets on our user-friendly mobile application that is visited by millions daily.

		<br>
		2.Employees’ warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit

		</br>
		<br>
		Our mission statement emphasizes customer service linked to employee behavior and corporate image. 
		The first point, involving high quality customer service, indicates the company’s strategic objectives for high standards 
		of operations that relate to customer service, such as customer support and marketing communications for the commercial aviation market. 
		Thus, the corporate mission statement focuses on customer experience as a variable in evaluating business performance, operational effectiveness, 
		and strategies, such as the strategies used in Southwest’s marketing mix or 4Ps. The company’s mission statement also highlights the importance of 
		desirable behaviors as factors that attract passengers. Considering these factors’ link to human resource management, Southwest Airlines Co.’s organizational
		culture is a major determinant in fulfilling the company’s mission statement.</p>
